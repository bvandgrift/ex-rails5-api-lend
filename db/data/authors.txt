As \u2018FK Salwood\u2019, he\u2019s indulged in historical novels about country matters. Garry likes to do something different each time, so if you want an author who has a string of books set in the same world with the same characters you\u2019re in the wrong part of the library.\r\n In 1980, Garry began writing children\u2019s books and this has become a major part of his output. The themes remain science fiction, fantasy, ghost stories and imaginative and speculative material, though \u2014 as with his adult books \u2014 there are some straight fiction novels amongst them. He goes into the schools to give talks to the kids about writers and writing and finds them both receptive and bright, even in so-called \u2018failing\u2019 schools. Students ask a lot of searching questions and Garry has to give sensible answers or they boo him. It\u2019s good fun and he learns a lot.\r\n In all Garry\u2019s been short-listed for about two dozen awards. He won the British Science Fiction Award, the World Fantasy Award, and the Interzone Magazine poll for the best short story for \u201cThe Ragthorn\u201d, which was written in collaboration with Robert Holdstock. Garry had previously won the Interzone Magazine award for \u201cThe Sculptor\u201d.

He was one of the first writers to break into mainstream, general magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post, in the late 1940s, with unvarnished science fiction. He was among the first authors of bestselling, novel-length science fiction in the modern, mass-market era. For many years, Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C.
